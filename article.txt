Is the future of healthcare really as bright as the AI marketers promise? In my upcoming book on Large Language Models in Healthcare, I strip away the sheen of optimistic portrayals to uncover the gritty reality behind the scenes. As we're tantalized with visions of a data-driven utopia where every medical detail is at our fingertips, the true story is far more complex. I've started to engage with the pioneers and the skeptics, dissecting both the dazzling potential and the daunting pitfalls of AI/LLMs in medicine. What emerges is a compelling, nuanced narrative of technological ambition clashing with practical realitiesâ€”a must-read for anyone intrigued by the future of healthcare.

My newest project involves writing a book on Large Language Models in Healthcare. This book aims to peel back the layers of glossy marketing to reveal how major players are actually implementing LLMs in the field. Everywhere we look, we're bombarded with optimistic portrayals: "Imagine a future where every nuance in the vast landscape of healthcare data is instantly accessible, where predictive insights and precise billing are at our fingertips, thanks to large language models (LLMs). This isn't just an ideal; it's a near reality." But beneath this polished surface lies a reality filled with missteps, misadventures, and a rush to board the AI train. As I delve into the burgeoning role of LLMs in healthcare, I am trying to engage with industry leaders who are both champions and skeptics of this technology. The insights I've already gathered paint a vivid picture of both the potential and the pitfalls of weaving AI into the very fabric of healthcare.

The excitement around LLMs in healthcare is undeniable. These models promise to revolutionize how we handle everything from patient data management to diagnostic processes, potentially leading to more personalized and efficient care. However, the implementation of such advanced technology is not without its challenges. High costs, the need for vast data integrations, and the complexities of training AI with unbiased, accurate data are just the tip of the iceberg.

Moreover, the enthusiasm from some quarters is tempered by caution from others. While some healthcare providers are eager to adopt these new tools, others are wary of the implications and potential disruptions to patient care. On top of that is the concern that over-reliance on AI could lead to a depersonalization of care, where data points overshadow the human aspects of medical practice.

Privacy and security concerns also loom large. With LLMs requiring access to extensive patient data to function effectively, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of this data has been at the forefront of many people as we watch so many hacks succeeded. Healthcare companies must navigate potential public backlash if patient data were ever compromised under their watch, if their clinical data was used to train a general LLM that a company was selling you might find major patient concerns. (Oh, wait, we see companies out there already doing this)

One of my public health concerns is that the uneven adoption of LLMs across different healthcare systems will likely exacerbate existing disparities in healthcare quality. While well-funded, technologically advanced institutions might benefit from AI, smaller, under-resourced facilities could fall further behind, widening the gap in healthcare.

One fascinating aspect of LLM implementation is the different approaches companies take. For instance, a vendor currently using LLMs to extract billing components from medical data illustrates the potential for reducing administrative costs and improving billing accuracy. However, this approach is initially very expensive requiring many many prompts to generate the output so its not without risks, including potential inaccuracies and the need for ongoing adjustments to align with evolving healthcare policies.

Right now I've been reaching out to healthcare organizations and software vendors to talk to their LLM teams. To positively highlight their choices in design so that we can see why they made directional choices. If you can help me with that I would love your help. I've had a couple companies accept, one major EHR vendor (Hurrah) and a couple turn me down hard. What companies do you want to hear from? Can you tag them in the comments?

Side-note: I've not written this type of book before and Its interesting to me because I will probably still use the publicly available information about those companies that were turning me down so hard but I won't have any motivation to do more than weigh the pro's and con's whereas if I talked to someone I'd be highly motivated to paint them in a positive light. When it costs them nothing aside from an hour zoom with their team it was odd to see them so concerned. I want a positive experience and writing tell all's is a great way to burn bridges, and I'm interested in building bridges in the industry. 

The story of LLMs in healthcare is complex and multifaceted. While the technology holds tremendous potential to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes, the road to its integration is paved with challenges. My book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this landscape, offering a balanced perspective that goes beyond the hype to explore the real impact of LLMs in healthcare.
